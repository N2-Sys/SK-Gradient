# Pretrained model

Before running our training script, we need to put the pre-trained model in this directory. All we need are three files: 

+ pytorch_model.bin
+ bert_config.json
+ vocab.txt

These files are available for download. The download link is as follows:
+ Bert-base-model: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-chinese.tar.gz
+ Vocabulary: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-chinese-vocab.txt

These links are collected by this repository [Bert-Chinese-Text-Classification-Pytorch](https://github.com/649453932/Bert-Chinese-Text-Classification-Pytorch).
